# Changesets Version PR automation
#
# On push to main, runs changesets/action which:
# - Detects pending changeset files in .changeset/
# - Creates or updates a "Version Packages" PR with bumped version and CHANGELOG
# - When the version PR is merged, publish.yml handles npm publish
#
# Split workflow pattern (separate from publish) per changesets/action#515.
# GITHUB_TOKEN is sufficient for PR creation -- no PAT needed.
