## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Bun Test chosen over Vitest (Vitest requires Node 20+, breaking Node 18+ target)
- [Roadmap]: npm publish with provenance via OIDC (bun publish --provenance not implemented)
- [Roadmap]: VS Code extension deferred to Phase 9 (requires stable core + monorepo extraction)
- [Roadmap]: Monorepo migration only when VS Code extension built (avoid premature restructuring)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Codebase has silent exception swallowing and tight I/O coupling (must refactor for testability in Phase 1)
- Context7 SDK is pre-1.0 (0.3.0) -- monitor for breaking changes
- `bun publish --provenance` not available -- must use npm for publish step
